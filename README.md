# Note-Taker

## Desciption
An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. 

## Goals

This application is designed to take and store notes. There are three functions to the note-taker:



* **Create Notes**  - Gives the ability to create notes and note titles.
* **Delete Notes** - Gives the ablility to delete any note you have created.
* **See Previous Notes** - Gives the ability to see and recall all previous notes.

## Complications

During the process of making this note taker app, I did run into some problems: 

* Creating an ID with each note:
    * In order to be able to delete each note, each should have a numerical ID that would identify the note you want to delete. I tried to use a for loop to find the highest current ID, then add 1 to it and add it to the note when the user saves it. I wasn't able to complete this code.
* Delete Route:
    * Without the ID for each note, I was unable to complete the delete route.
* Using the Pre-made Code
    * It was challanging working with the front-end which was already built for us. It was a good challange to have to read someone else's code and work with it.

## Credits and Thanks

Thank you to Poornima for helping me with Heroku and my code, and a big shout out to Colin who spent a LOT of time helping me both in class and online.
